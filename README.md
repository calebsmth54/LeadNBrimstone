# LeadNBrimstone

Here you'll find the near complete code for the project. I have provided it here so that others can see a near complete UE4 code base as well as learn how to implement some key features for their own 3D sidescrolling projects.

Feel free to edit this code or use it in your own projects. I just ask that if you update the code or find a bug, that you spread the love and update it here as well!

Contact me at calebsmth54@gmail.com if you have any questions!
